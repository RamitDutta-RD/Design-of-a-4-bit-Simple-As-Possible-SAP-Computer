# Design-of-a-4-bit-Simple-As-Possible-SAP-Computer
In this project, we have built a 4-bit simple as possible computer using VerilogHDL. 
In this project, we have built a 4-bit simple as possible computer using VerilogHDL. To demonstrate that the computer is working properly, we have written testbenches for all instructions separately and presented the waveforms both using EDA tools and Cadence SimVision. Using Cadence Genus allowed us to see the full view of the schematic along with the power and timing report. Then, using Cadence Innovus, we designed the physical layout.
